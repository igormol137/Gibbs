# Hopefield Network for Time-series Completion
#
# Igor Mol <igor.mol@makes.ai>
#
# Abstract:
# The approach implemented in the following program demonstrates the application 
# of the Hopfield Networks for time-series completion, offering a systematic 
# framework for modeling and predicting missing values in sequential data. 
#     A class named HopfieldNetwork is utilized to model and predict missing 
# values in a time series. The network is initialized with a specified size, and
# the weights matrix, representing the connections between neurons, is set to 
# zeros initially. The training method updates these weights based on the outer 
# product of input patterns, excluding self-connections to prevent distortion.
#     The prediction process involves iteratively updating the output pattern 
# using the dot product with the weights matrix. This updated pattern is deter-
# mined by applying a sign function to the dot product result. The number of 
# iterations is user-defined, influencing the convergence of the predicted 
# pattern.
#
# "The memory has already entered your consciousness, but you must find it. It 
# will appear in dreams, in your waking hours, when you turn the page of a book 
# or a corner. Do not be impatient, do not invent memories. Chance might favor 
# or delay you, in its own mysterious way. As I begin to forget, you will begin 
# to remember. I promise nothing more".

# Two utility functions, normalize_data and denormalize_pattern, assist in pre-
# processing the time series. normalize_data scales the data to the [0, 1] ran-
# ge, while denormalize_pattern reverts a normalized pattern to its original 
# scale based on the original minimum and maximum values.

# In the main function, time series data is loaded from a CSV file and subse-
# quently normalized using the utility functions. A Hopfield Network instance is 
# created, and the network is trained with the normalized time series values. A 
# subset of the time series, such as the first half, is chosen as the input 
# pattern.
#     The Hopfield Network is then employed to predict the remaining values in 
# the time series. The predicted and input patterns are denormalized to their 
# original scale, and the results are presented in a tabular format. Additiona-
# lly, a graphical representation is provided through a time series plot that 
# showcases the actual, input, and predicted values.
