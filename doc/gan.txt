The code gan.py implements a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for time series analysis. The GAN comprises a generator and a discriminator, trained iteratively to generate realistic synthetic time series data. The code begins by initializing the TimeSeriesGAN class with parameters such as the file path to a CSV containing time series data and the latent dimension for the generator. The class includes methods for loading and preprocessing the data, building the generator, discriminator, and the GAN model itself.

The build_generator and build_discriminator methods define the architecture of the generator and discriminator, respectively. Both models consist of dense layers, LeakyReLU activation, and batch normalization. The generator aims to create synthetic time series data, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and generated data. The GAN is formed by combining the generator and discriminator models. The training process involves updating the discriminator with real and generated data and updating the generator to fool the discriminator. Throughout training, the discriminator and generator losses are calculated and printed at intervals.

The train_gan method orchestrates the GAN training process for a specified number of epochs. It generates synthetic time series, updates the discriminator, calculates and prints losses, and computes the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between actual and generated time series. The overall trend of MSE is plotted for visualization. The code concludes with the visualize_results method, which generates synthetic time series for the entire dataset, creates a DataFrame with actual and generated data, prints the results in a formatted table, and plots the actual and generated time series for visual comparison.

In summary, the code demonstrates the application of GANs to time series data, showcasing their ability to learn and generate realistic synthetic sequences that capture the underlying patterns present in the original time series dataset.
