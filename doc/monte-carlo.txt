The code monte-carol.py implements a Monte Carlo method for the detection and handling of anomalies in time series data. The code defines a class named MonteCarloAnomalyDetection, initialized with parameters such as the file path to a CSV containing time series data, a threshold for anomaly detection, and the number of simulations for anomaly replacement. The class encapsulates attributes like file path, threshold, number of simulations, a DataFrame for time series data, anomalies, and replaced values.

The load_data method reads and organizes the time series data. The detect_anomalies method utilizes Z-scores, calculating the difference between data points and the mean divided by the standard deviation. Anomalies are identified when the Z-score exceeds the defined threshold. The replace_anomalies method replaces anomalies using Monte Carlo simulations, generating simulated values based on the mean and standard deviation of the data for each detected anomaly.

The run_anomaly_detection method executes the anomaly detection process, calling load_data, detect_anomalies, and replace_anomalies to populate the anomalies and replaced values. The display_results method presents the results in a formatted table, including the date, original values, replaced values, and an indicator for anomalies. The plot_time_series method creates a time series plot highlighting the original and replaced values, with detected anomalies marked in red.

In the main function, an instance of the MonteCarloAnomalyDetection class is created, the anomaly detection process is executed, and the results are displayed in both a table and a time series plot. The Monte Carlo method used in this code leverages randomness through simulations, offering a flexible and effective approach to handling outliers and uncertainties in time series data, demonstrating its versatility in practical applications.
