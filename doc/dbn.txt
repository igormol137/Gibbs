The code dbn.py implements a Deep Belief Network (DBN) for time series prediction using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers. The DBNModel class is defined to encapsulate the architecture and functionality of the model. The constructor initializes parameters such as sequence length, CNN filters, CNN kernel size, and LSTM units. The build_model method assembles the DBN architecture using a Sequential model from the Keras library. It includes a 1D Convolutional layer with ReLU activation, a MaxPooling layer for down-sampling, an LSTM layer with ReLU activation, and a Dense output layer. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.

The main function, designated by the if name == "main": block, orchestrates the overall process. It loads time series data from a CSV file, preprocesses it by scaling the values using Min-Max normalization, and structures the data into input sequences and target values. The DBN model is instantiated, trained on the training set, and then used to predict the target values on the test set. The predictions are denormalized to their original scale using the Min-Max scaler. Two functions, print_table and plot_actual_vs_predicted, are defined to visually assess the model's performance. print_table generates a tabulated display of actual versus predicted values, while plot_actual_vs_predicted produces a time series plot comparing the actual and predicted values.

In summary, the code demonstrates the construction and utilization of a DBN model for time series prediction, specifically tailored to sequences with a given length. The integration of CNN and LSTM layers allows the model to capture both local patterns through convolutional operations and long-term dependencies through recurrent connections. The script culminates in the presentation of the model's predictions, enabling an evaluation of its effectiveness in capturing the underlying patterns within the time series data.
