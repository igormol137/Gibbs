The code rst-boltzmann.py implements a Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) for the generation of time series data. The code is organized into two main classes: TimeSeriesData for preprocessing the input time series data and RBM for the RBM implementation. The preprocessing involves converting the 'Date' column to datetime, scaling the 'Value' column using MinMaxScaler, and creating sequences of data suitable for training the RBM.

The RBM class is equipped with methods for training the model using contrastive divergence and generating samples. The training process unfolds through iterations and involves shuffling the data, updating weights and biases based on the difference between positive and negative associations. The primary objective of this code is to illustrate the application of RBMs for time series data generation. RBMs, being unsupervised learning models, are adept at capturing underlying patterns and structures in the time series data.

The training process, outlined in the RBM class, iteratively adjusts parameters to capture statistical dependencies within the input data. This enables the model to generate synthetic time series sequences that exhibit similar patterns to the original data. The denormalized generated samples are presented in tabulated form, allowing a direct visual comparison between the actual and generated sequences. This RBM-based approach is versatile, finding applications in anomaly detection, data augmentation, and creating realistic synthetic data for testing machine learning models.

The TimeSeriesData class handles the initial loading and preprocessing of time series data, converting the 'Date' column to datetime, scaling the 'Value' column using MinMaxScaler, and creating sequences suitable for RBM training. The RBM class includes the definition of the sigmoid activation function and methods for sampling hidden and visible layers. The training process involves both positive and negative phases, where hidden and visible layer states are sampled iteratively. The weights and biases are updated using contrastive divergence, a technique specific to RBMs. Finally, the main function orchestrates the entire workflow, from loading the data to training the RBM, generating denormalized samples, and creating a table that compares the actual and generated time series sequences using the 'tabulate' library for a more readable output.
