The code next-frame.py implements a time series modeling approach known as the Next-Frame Technique using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. This modeling is encapsulated within the TimeSeriesModel class, which orchestrates the complete process. The program commences by reading time series data from a CSV file and normalizing it using Min-Max scaling. The normalized data is then transformed into sequences of input-output pairs, suitable for training an LSTM model. The architecture of the LSTM model is constructed using the Keras library, with a focus on predicting future values in the time series.

Following the model's training, predictions are generated on a test set, and both the predictions and actual values are denormalized to their original scales. The program outputs a tabulated comparison between the predicted and actual values, providing a quantitative assessment of the model's performance. Additionally, it creates a time series plot for a visual inspection of the predicted and actual values. This Next-Frame approach aids in understanding and forecasting patterns in time series data, offering insights into potential future trends.

The TimeSeriesModel class is designed to encapsulate the functionalities of time series modeling. It includes methods for loading and normalizing time series data, creating input-output sequences for the LSTM model, building and training the LSTM model, denormalizing data, generating predictions, printing results in a tabulated form, and plotting the time series. The architecture of the LSTM model consists of an LSTM layer with 50 units and a ReLU activation function, followed by a dense layer with a single unit. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss.

The main function orchestrates the entire process by instantiating the TimeSeriesModel class, loading and preprocessing the data, creating sequences, splitting the data into training and testing sets, building and training the LSTM model, generating predictions, denormalizing the data, and finally, printing the results table and plotting the time series. The flexibility of LSTM networks enables the model to capture long-term dependencies and patterns in time series data, making it effective for a wide range of prediction tasks.
