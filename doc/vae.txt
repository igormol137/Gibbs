The code vae.py implements a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for the reconstruction of time series data, combining classical statistical principles with modern neural network techniques. The VAE architecture involves an encoder, a reparameterization trick, and a decoder. The encoder transforms input time series into a condensed representation in a latent space, introducing a reparameterization trick to navigate the uncertainty in this space. The decoder then reconstructs the time series from the latent representation. The VAE is trained using a loss function that incorporates cross-entropy loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence, refining its understanding of time series through stochastic gradient descent. The encoded series provides insights into the latent space, and the reconstructed series is brought back to the original scale. This process exemplifies the VAE's capability to comprehend and reconstruct time series data, showcasing the integration of classical and modern approaches.

The VAE class is defined with parameters for the original dimension, intermediate layer dimension, and latent space dimension. The build_model method constructs the VAE model, incorporating an encoder and decoder with specific architectures. The training process involves fitting the VAE model on the provided time series data, refining its parameters to achieve effective reconstruction. The predict method is then used to obtain reconstructed time series based on the trained model. Normalization and denormalization functions are provided to scale and revert the data accordingly. The main function loads time series data, normalizes it, creates and trains the VAE model, predicts reconstructed series, and visualizes the results through a formatted table and a plot comparing actual and reconstructed time series.

In summary, the code demonstrates the application of a Variational Autoencoder to time series data, emphasizing the model's ability to capture latent representations and reconstruct original time series, providing a bridge between classical statistical methods and contemporary neural network advancements.
